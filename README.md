This is an implementation of a disolve effect I made for my own game. It's inspired by the article by Glowfish interactive https://madewith.unity.com/stories/dissolving-the-world-part-2

IMPORTANT NOTICE:
This programm uses the noise implementation Lex-DRL that you can find here: https://forum.unity3d.com/threads/2d-3d-4d-optimised-perlin-noise-cg-hlsl-library-cginc.218372/ It will not work without it.

You should further notice that I am not a professional programmer and made this in my sparetime. So I can not guarantee you that this code is the most efficient or bug proof it can be. It's only ment for demonstrational purposes.
